## üìÇ Source‚ÄëCode Conventions

### Directory Structure

```
src/
  types/           # TypeScript type definitions
  ui/              # Reusable UI components (primitives)
  core/            # Business logic, hooks, utilities
  pages/           # Page-level components (route handlers)
  components/      # App-specific components (feature components)
  styles/          # Global styles and design tokens
  main.tsx         # Application entry point
  App.tsx          # Root component & routing
```

### Architectural Layers

1. **UI Layer (`/ui/`)**: Pure presentational primitives
   - No business logic, just props and styling
   - Follows design system tokens from DESIGN-PRINCIPLES.md
   - Examples: Button, Card, Modal, Input, Badge, Spinner
   - Uses CVA (class-variance-authority) for variant management

2. **Component Layer (`/components/`)**: Feature-specific compositions
   - Composed from UI primitives
   - Accept typed props, minimal state
   - Implements experience pillars: transparency, momentum, control

3. **Page Layer (`/pages/`)**: Route orchestration
   - Data fetching via React Query with proper caching
   - Error/loading state handling with skeletons
   - Compose feature components into user journeys

* Import path alias: `@/*` (e.g., `@/core/hooks`)
* **Error UX:** Use `@/ui/toast` for API error surfaces; avoid `alert()`

### Business Logic Rules

1. **Pure functions** in `src/core/utils`; unit‚Äëtest each edge case
2. **State transitions** are explicit and validated
3. Keep logic simple and testable

---

## üß™ Testing Checklist

* Unit tests co‚Äëlocated next to source (`*.test.ts`)
* Integration test for critical user journeys
* Current coverage target: **>93%**
* E2E tests for critical user journeys (Playwright/Cypress)

## üöÄ Dev Workflow

```bash
pnpm install      # fresh install
pnpm dev          # Vite dev server @ localhost:5173
pnpm test         # Vitest in watch mode
pnpm test:run     # Run tests once and exit
pnpm lint         # ESLint check
pnpm type-check   # TypeScript validation
pnpm build        # Production build
pnpm size-limit   # Bundle size check
```

**CI Pipeline:** `pnpm install ‚Üí lint ‚Üí type-check ‚Üí test:run ‚Üí build ‚Üí size-limit` (enforces 6MB bundle limit).

---

## üìã Implementation Guidelines

### 0 ‚Äî Purpose & Domain Context

These rules ensure maintainability and developer velocity for a **professional web application**.

**MUST** rules are critical; **SHOULD** rules are recommendations.

**Design North Star:** Professional, transparent, trustworthy.

**Experience Pillars:**
1. **Transparency** - Clear, obvious user flows
2. **Momentum** - Actions feel rewarding
3. **Control** - Users manage their experience
4. **Credibility** - Feels like a real professional platform
5. **Simplicity** - Focus on core features, no clutter

---

### 1 ‚Äî Before Coding

- **BP-1 (MUST)** Keep it simple - if unsure, choose the simpler approach.
- **BP-2 (SHOULD)** Ask clarifying questions to understand requirements fully.
- **BP-3 (SHOULD)** Confirm approach for any feature beyond basic CRUD.
- **BP-4 (SHOULD)** If ‚â• 2 approaches exist, list clear pros and cons.

---

### 2 ‚Äî While Coding

- **C-1 (MUST)** Write minimal, working code first - optimize later if needed.
- **C-2 (SHOULD)** Follow TDD when practical: scaffold stub ‚Üí write failing test ‚Üí implement.
- **C-3 (MUST)** Use consistent vocabulary throughout the codebase.
- **C-4 (SHOULD NOT)** Over-engineer - no classes, patterns, or abstractions unless essential.
- **C-5 (SHOULD)** Keep functions pure and testable where possible.
- **C-6 (SHOULD NOT)** Extract new functions unless reused elsewhere, needed for unit testing, or drastically improves readability.
- **C-7 (MUST)** Use TypeScript strict mode - catch errors early.
- **C-8 (MUST)** Use `import type { ‚Ä¶ }` for type-only imports.
- **C-9 (SHOULD NOT)** Add real-time features initially - keep it request/response.
- **C-10 (SHOULD NOT)** Add comments unless absolutely critical - prefer self-explanatory code.
- **C-11 (MUST)** Follow design system tokens for all styling.
- **C-12 (MUST)** Implement proper loading, error, and empty states.

---

### 3 ‚Äî Testing Strategy

- **T-1 (MUST)** Write at least one test for business logic functions.
- **T-2 (SHOULD)** Colocate tests in `*.test.ts` files next to source files.
- **T-3 (MUST)** Test critical business logic thoroughly with edge cases.
- **T-4 (SHOULD)** Separate pure-logic unit tests from integration tests.
- **T-5 (SHOULD)** Test the entire structure in one assertion when possible:
  ```ts
  expect(result).toEqual({ value: 15 }) // ‚úÖ Good

  expect(result.value).toBe(15);        // ‚ùå Avoid multiple assertions
  ```
- **T-6 (SHOULD NOT)** Add tests that can't fail for real defects - every test must catch bugs.
- **T-7 (SHOULD)** Parameterize test inputs - avoid unexplained literals like 42 or "foo".

---

### 4 ‚Äî Data Management Patterns

- **D-1 (MUST)** Keep data operations simple and predictable.
- **D-2 (SHOULD)** Use React Query for caching and state management.
- **D-3 (MUST)** Handle errors gracefully - show user-friendly messages.

---

- **O-2 (MUST)** Keep all business logic in `src/core`
- **O-3 (SHOULD)** Export through barrel exports (`index.ts`)
- **O-4 (MUST)** Use `@/*` import aliases instead of relative paths
- **O-5 (MUST)** Follow component architecture: UI ‚Üí Components ‚Üí Pages
- **O-6 (SHOULD)** Co-locate tests with source files (`*.test.ts`)

---

### 6 ‚Äî Performance

- **P-1 (MUST)** Show loading states for all async operations.
- **P-2 (SHOULD)** Use React Query for server state caching.
- **P-3 (SHOULD NOT)** Optimize prematurely - get it working first.
- **P-4 (MUST)** Keep bundle size under 6MB gzipped (optimize for <5MB when possible).
- **P-5 (SHOULD)** Use skeleton screens for perceived performance.

---

### 7 ‚Äî Tooling

- **G-1 (MUST)** TypeScript must compile with no errors.
- **G-2 (SHOULD)** Keep build time under 30 seconds.
- **G-3 (MUST)** Use `pnpm` for package management.

---

### 8 ‚Äî Git & Deployment

- **GH-1 (MUST)** Use Conventional Commits: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `docs:`, `style:`, `refactor:`, `test:`
- **GH-2 (SHOULD)** Deploy to Vercel for automatic previews
- **GH-3 (MUST)** Never commit `.env` files
- **GH-4 (MUST)** NO PRE-COMMIT HOOKS - they cause data loss and session resets
- **GH-5 (MUST)** Tag releases with `vMAJOR.MINOR.PATCH`
- **GH-6 (SHOULD)** Write meaningful commit messages that explain the "why"

## üìã Writing Functions Best Practices

When evaluating whether a function is good, use this checklist:

1. **Can you read the function and HONESTLY understand it immediately?** If yes, ship it.
2. **Is it doing one thing?** If not, split it.
3. **Is it testable?** If not, remove side effects.
4. **Is the name clear?** If not, rename it.
5. **Are the types explicit?** If not, add proper TypeScript types.
6. **Does it have high cyclomatic complexity?** Too many nested if/else = refactor.
7. **Are there unused parameters?** Remove them.
8. **Are there unnecessary type casts?** Move to function arguments.
9. **Any hidden dependencies?** Factor them into arguments.

**IMPORTANT**: Don't over-engineer. Simple > Clever.

**Example of good function:**
```typescript
export const formatCurrency = (amount: number, currency: string = 'MXN'): string => {
  return new Intl.NumberFormat('es-MX', {
    style: 'currency',
    currency,
  }).format(amount);
};
```

**When to extract a function:**
- It's used in more than one place
- It's the only way to unit test untestable logic
- The original function is extremely hard to follow

---

## üß™ Writing Tests Best Practices

When evaluating test quality, use this checklist:

1. **Test business logic** - Core functionality must be correct
2. **Test happy paths** - Basic flows should work
3. **Test edge cases** - Boundaries, unexpected input, realistic scenarios
4. **One logical assertion per test** - Keep tests focused
5. **Test behavior, not implementation** - Focus on outcomes
6. **Parameterize inputs** - Never embed unexplained literals like 42 or "foo"
7. **Use strong assertions** - `toEqual(1)` not `toBeGreaterThanOrEqual(1)`
8. **Group by function** - Use `describe(functionName, () => ...)`
9. **No trivial tests** - Every test must catch real defects

**Example test structure:**
```typescript
describe('formatCurrency', () => {
  test('formats MXN correctly', () => {
    const amount = 1000;
    expect(formatCurrency(amount)).toBe('$1,000.00');
  });

  test('handles zero amount', () => {
    expect(formatCurrency(0)).toBe('$0.00');
  });
});
```

## üöÄ Development Workflow

### Local Development

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Start development
pnpm dev                    # Start web app at localhost:5173

# Quality checks
pnpm lint                  # Run linting
pnpm type-check           # Check types
pnpm test                 # Run tests (watch mode)
pnpm test:run             # Run tests once and exit
```

### Production Commands

```bash
# Build for production
pnpm build

# Check bundle size (must be under 6MB gzipped, target <5MB)
pnpm size-limit

# Run specific test
pnpm test <test-name>
pnpm test:run <test-name>  # Run specific test once and exit

# Pre-deployment checks
pnpm ci                   # Run all checks (lint, type-check, test, build)
```

## üìñ Important Reminders

### Technical Excellence
- **Keep it simple** - Maximum value for minimum complexity
- **Type safety is mandatory** - No `any` types, explicit interfaces
- **Performance matters** - Stay under 6MB bundle size (optimize for <5MB when feasible)
- **NO PRE-COMMIT HOOKS** - They cause session resets and data loss
- **Design system adherence** - Every component follows established patterns
- **Mobile-first approach** - Test BottomNavBar and viewport detection
- **Test coverage target** - Maintain >93% coverage

### Development Philosophy
- **Test critical paths** - Focus on business logic and user journeys
- **Ship working features** - Polish comes through iteration
- **User experience first** - Every interaction should feel polished
- **Design consistency** - Follow the design system religiously
- **Progressive enhancement** - Mobile first, enhance for desktop
- **Accessibility matters** - WCAG AA compliance is non-negotiable
- **Clean up as you go** - Remove console.warn statements before committing
- **Performance monitoring** - Add React.memo to frequently re-rendered components

### Design Implementation
- **Follow experience pillars** - Transparency, momentum, control, credibility, simplicity
- **Use design tokens** - Colors, spacing, typography from design system
- **Implement all states** - Loading (skeletons), empty (helpful CTAs), error (retry options)
- **Motion with purpose** - Subtle transitions that enhance UX
- **Responsive patterns** - Stack ‚Üí Grid, horizontal scroll ‚Üí Grid, collapsed ‚Üí Full

## üìå Important Instruction Reminders

- **Do what has been asked; nothing more, nothing less.**
- **NEVER create files unless they're absolutely necessary for achieving the goal.**
- **ALWAYS prefer editing an existing file to creating a new one.**
- **NEVER proactively create documentation files (*.md) or README files. Only create documentation if explicitly requested.**
- **NO PRE-COMMIT HOOKS EVER** - They cause data loss and session resets
- **ALWAYS run quality checks manually** - Use QREVIEW shortcut before committing
- **Review the consolidated docs** - Check `/docs` folder for comprehensive guides

---

### Reminder: **Do what's asked, nothing extra.**

*This guide is specific to professional web application development. Always prioritize simplicity, working code, and fast iteration while maintaining professional standards.*
